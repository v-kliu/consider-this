## Overview

**Consider This** was founded at the **Berkeley AI Hackathon 2024** with a mission to foster healthy, empathetic discussions using AI. In today's digital age, algorithms curate content that often reflects our preferences, creating an "echo chamber" that reinforces biases and limits exposure to diverse opinions. This is especially concerning for the younger generation, who might struggle to engage in productive conversations or make informed decisions due to these echo chambers.

Our innovative educational tool leverages Hume's cutting-edge EVI technology to help users think critically and break free from these digital confines.

## Problem Statement

The younger generation is particularly affected by digital echo chambers, which can limit their exposure to diverse perspectives and hinder their ability to think critically. How can we encourage our youth to think critically, break free from echo chambers, and engage more thoughtfully?

## Solution

Imagine you are a shy eighth-grader named Zelda. Your teacher introduces an assignment involving a dialogue with two influential figures holding divergent views on AI. You log onto the platform "Consider This" and engage in a discussion with Dr. Aisha Patel, a senior research scientist pioneering drug discovery using AI, and Valentino Rossi, an art gallery and studio owner cautious about art plagiarism in AI. This experience broadens your understanding of AI, boosts your confidence, and teaches you critical thinking, empathy, and the complex interplay of technology and society.
